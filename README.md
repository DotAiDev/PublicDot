# Welcome to the .AI Project

This is a [.AI](https://dotai.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-dotai-app`](https://dotai.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-dotai-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`dotai/font`](https://dotai.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Prompt-Based Particle Orientation in Three.js Using AI

In the realm of 3D graphics, Three.js is a powerful library that allows developers to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser. By integrating AI, specifically prompt-based systems, developers can dynamically orient particles in a scene based on user input or predefined prompts. This approach leverages AI to interpret the prompts and adjust the orientation, speed, and behavior of particles, creating a more interactive and responsive experience. The AI can analyze the context of the prompt to determine the most suitable orientation, making it possible to create complex animations with minimal manual intervention.
